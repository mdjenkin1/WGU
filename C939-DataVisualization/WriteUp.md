# The Cost of Daylight Savings

I have no love of daylight savings time (DST). If it was just readjusting clocks twice a year, it wouldn't seem that bad. But it's much worse. There's a constant question of what timezone was a datetime recorded in. Is Phoenix an hour behind? Do I label my time as daylight or standard when sprung forward or fell back? All this and more just to make sundials accurate. No one uses sundials anymore. I doubt anyone that ever used a sundial needed them for their accuracy.

No one has any argument for the efficiency of daylight savings. It's an unnecessary complication to any time dependant system. There's no rational argument for its inclusion. It's implementation as a requirement is not without cost. What then is the cost of maintaining DST?
