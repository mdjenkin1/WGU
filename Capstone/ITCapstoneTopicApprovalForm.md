# T Capstone Topic Approval Form

The purpose of this document is to help you clearly explain your capstone topic, project scope, and timeline, and to assure that they align with your degree emphasis. Without clearly addressing each of these areas, you will not have a complete and realistic overview of your project and your Course Instructor cannot accurately assessed whether your project will be doable for the purposes of these courses.  

Of course, if this a project that you have already completed at work or elsewhere, this should be easy to fill in! Most students use a project that they have already completed in the past year or two. In that case, you will write the proposals (Tasks 1 and 2) as if the project has not been done yet, and Task 3 as the complete post-implementation report.  

Complete this form and send it (via UGCapstoneIT@WGU.edu) to your Course Instructor for approval. Once approved, you will receive a signed document in PDF format that you can upload as part of Task 1.
