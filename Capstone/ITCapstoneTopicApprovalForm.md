# T Capstone Topic Approval Form

The purpose of this document is to help you clearly explain your capstone topic, project scope, and timeline, and to assure that they align with your degree emphasis. Without clearly addressing each of these areas, you will not have a complete and realistic overview of your project and your Course Instructor cannot accurately assessed whether your project will be doable for the purposes of these courses.  

Of course, if this a project that you have already completed at work or elsewhere, this should be easy to fill in! Most students use a project that they have already completed in the past year or two. In that case, you will write the proposals (Tasks 1 and 2) as if the project has not been done yet, and Task 3 as the complete post-implementation report.  

Complete this form and send it (via UGCapstoneIT@WGU.edu) to your Course Instructor for approval. Once approved, you will receive a signed document in PDF format that you can upload as part of Task 1.

## ANALYSIS

### Project Topic

Identifying Contributors to Air Travel Delay  

### Problem Statement or Project Purpose

Ever since the advent of mass transit, keeping the trains on time has been a challenge. In the world of trains, only one train could be on a track at a time. If one train was late, it would impact every other train waiting to use that same track. When one train is late, every other train would become late. A similar issue for air travel exists where only only one plane can occupy a runway.  

If can we identify contributors to air travel delay then steps can be taken to mitigate their impact.

## DESIGN and DEVELOPMENT

Project Scope

a. Project Goal(s) and Supporting Objectives

    * Provide the means to identify major contributors to air travel delay.

b. Project Outcomes and Deliverables

    * ETL pipeline of historic air travel scheduling information
    * Data store consumable by Business Intelligence process
    * Proof of concept report showing possible BI use

c. Projected Project End Date

    * January 31, 2020

## IMPLEMENTATION and EVALUATION

The source data for ETL pipeline development originates from the Statistical Computing department of the American Statistical Association.

* [http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html)

This is historical data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

* [BTS](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp)

Source data will be consumed to our purpose via deliverable ETL pipeline.  
Data consumption will result in population of data store deliverable.  
Proof of concept will then be generated from interaction with data store.
