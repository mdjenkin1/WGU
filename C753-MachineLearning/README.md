# Udacity Machine Learning Course Project

This project originated with the starter code provided by Udacity: [https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git)  

## Files

**ud120:** Edited versions of the files Udacity in a mostly original directory structure.
**my_project:** Only those files necessary to the final project.

Each directory is atomic. This way it is clear what is relevant.
