# Brain Dump and Development Documentation

To complete this project I'll need to answer a series of questions.  

* What is the goal?
* What features were used and why?
* Which algorithms were tried?
* How was the algorithm tuned?
* How was the analysis validated?
* Generate and evaluate metrics.

From my experience, each company has their own vocabulary. Each group within that company has their own dialect of that vocabulary. It would follow the clique committing fraud would have their own dialect. The goal of our machine learner is to identify this dialect used by people of interest. We can then use this dialect to identify potential people of interest.
