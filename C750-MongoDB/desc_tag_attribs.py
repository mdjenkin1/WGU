'k' attributes only exist in tags.
Tags only exist in Nodes, Ways, and Relations.
Which 'k' attributes exist for each parent tag type?

'k' attributes are paired with 'v' attributes.
For 'v' attributes paired to the 'k' attributes, what value types do they contain.

answer these questions with the following data structure:
[
    {
        'k': <value>,
        'v': [<type>, <type>]
    },
    ...
