## C751 - Data Analysis with R

_Lessons in data analysis with some R thrown in there._  

The project is an analysis of wine data. It seeks to answer the question: 
How does composition relate to wine quality? The short of it is you want a low 
salt \(~5mg\) and high alcohol (~13.5%) content wine.
